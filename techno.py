shifted the chroniton particles in our hull into a high state of temporal polarisation.", "It appears to be a highly focused aperture in the space-time continuum.","Its energy signature matches that of the temporal fragments we observed earlier, but it is approximately one point two million times as intense.","I believe this may be the origin of the temporal fragmentation.","Fortunately, I was able to create a chrononton-infused serum that brought you back into temporal alignment.","When it travels through a transwarp corridor, the temporal stresses are extreme. To keep the different sections of it in temporal sync, we project a chronoton field throughout the vessel.","Each ship has specially designed conduits. If we install similar conduits throughout this vessel, then generate a sufficiently powerful field, we may be able to force our ship back into temporal sync.","The vessel will return to the moment of the original chrono-kinetic surge. Since the surge will last for six or seven seconds, we will have a short time in which we could try to counteract the warp core reaction.","Even if we could replicate these conduits, we would have no way to get them through the temporal barriers.","Bioneural circuitry runs through every section of the ship, almost like a nervous system.","If we could inject the gel packs with your serum, we could use them to transmit the chronoton field, and the warp core could be recalibrated to generate that field.","In order to complete the scheduled observations, the lateral sensors will require additional processing time.","We could steal a couple of hours while they're recalibrating the thermal interferometry scanner.","A couple of hours should be enough time to complete the high-resolution series on the neutron star.","It is not really a problem, because we can just double up the main sensor bandwidth.","After we launch our target drone, our ship will have to generate a subspace tensor matrix in the twenty five to thirty thousand Cochrane range.","The drone will send out a magneton pulse which should react with the matrix to create an opening in the space-time continuum.","We'll have to reroute the pre-ignition plasma from the impulse deck down to the auxiliary intake to get that much power, but I think we can do it.","The backup navigation system is still showing some calibration drift; I think some data may have been lost in the startup routine.","It explains the seven percent falloff in the AFR ratios I keep seeing.","It must be a problem with the diagnostic sub-routines.","I have a recalibration unit in my quarters that might solve the problem.","Our best guess is that the tetryon field reacted to the probe's shielding, producing a massive graviton wave.","Energize the focal array and stand by to initiate the subspace tensor matrix.","I think that this AQF sequencer has always caused me the worst problems.","The plasma coil interlocks are in place, and the deflector grid is standing by.","The tensor matrix is forming, so you should activate the drone.","The drone is sending out the magneton pulse, which means it's reached the matrix.","I'm picking up a subspace distortion, which is becoming coherent, which means it's working.","The magneton pulse is causing a feedback loop which will destroy the drone in a few seconds.","The warp core is offline, and auxiliary power is at forty seven percent.","A coolant leak is flooding the engine room with plasma and fusing the magnetic injectors into a quantum protonic state.","We're purging ten thousand terabytes out of the main computer for the purpose of developing a hyper-chaotic verteron field to channel through the main deflector and the nacelles to create a cascading warp field intermix bubble.","It just occurred to me that I could set up a frequency harmonic between the deflector and the shield grid using the warp field generator as a power flow anti-attenuator and that of course naturally creates an amplification of the inherent energy output.","I still don't see how you can incorporate the quantum principle into general relativity without adjusting the cosmological constant a lot more than you're doing here.","We are experiencing a quantum level oscillation delay.","Our computer system is controlled by three primary main processing cores linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat and fourteen kiloquad interface modules.","The core elements are based on faster than light nanoprocessor units arranged into twenty five bilateral kelilactirals with twenty of those units being slaved to the central heisenframe terminal.","This is the isopalavial interface which controls the main firomactal drive unit, and if you touch it you'll blow up the entire firomactal drive.","It's a simple matter of extracting the iconometric elements and triaxilating a recursion matrix.", "*farts*"]
