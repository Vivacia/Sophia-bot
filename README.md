# Sophia-bot
<p>
A chat-bot created by Vivacia/Varnika on April 5, 2018 based on an old and dusty bot created by cuisinart8 a few years ago. Her older and obsolete version had bits and pieces of code from fully functional bots like Taiya/TaiyaIRC by Talvieno, Saoirse/Dinobot by Dinosawer and Jimmy by cha0zz. Special thanks to lycurgus for helping me debug her a lot. :D

<p>
Runs primarily in Discord and IRC. She behaves like a five year old girl and can look up Wikipedia articles, link youtube videos and define words, toss out their antonyms and synonyms when asked to do so.

<p>
Her code is supposed to mold around the users and hence there is not a fixed command to make her do things: she understands users’ requests and acts accordingly.

</p>
<ol>

<li>Fix the Google function.

<li>A function that links images when asked to.

<li>Emotions, or rather, an emotion counter, inspired by Taiya. She will keep track of people using her and based on their behaviour towards her, she will respond. After a certain amount of negativity, she shushes. I’m not sure if this is a good idea but it would be fun to experiment with.

<li>Ability to recognise users when talked to; easier to implement than emotions.

<li>Battleship game.

<li>Math functions? Not sure if this is needed.

Usually, <strong><code>Sophia</code> </strong>or <strong><code>Soph</code> </strong>is her trigger word. It brings her attention to most commands though some work without it. Simply saying <strong><code>Sophia </code></strong>or <strong><code>Soph</code> </strong>without a command programmed in her does nothing.
